\chapter{Mapping algorithms}

The generic package exists for two reasons. First, the wrappers \texttt{mbg-map}, \texttt{mbg-infer} etc. are much easier for people to use that PyMC itself. Second, PyMC's GP package is too general to do garden-variety geostatistics in an optimized way. This section describes the generic package's mapping algorithms. These may eventually be back-ported into PyMC as special fast-path methods of \texttt{pymc.gp.Realization}.
